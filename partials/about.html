      <p>Liliana Carvalho is a Portuguese architect and sound artist that operates between London [UK] and Porto [PT].She graduated in Architecture [2009] which got her to study and work in Poland, Portugal, Germany and UK. Whilst studying she worked as radio technician and broadcaster for several years on different electronic music radio-shows. She was also invited to DJ and manage events with the Portuguese techno promoter and label Soniculture and to be part of the production team at Forte Festival 2014. The co-founding and project managing of SonicLab’s early stages was the milestone for forthcoming sonic projects, starting with a Sound Art installation shortlisted and premiered at Semibreve Festival 2014 in collaboration with musician XNX.Whilst working as an architect in 2017 she decided to study Sound Art in London. This became a decisive step to develop sonic works with a continuous expression of the reciprocity narrative of Sound and Space.</p>

      <h1>approach</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>I am interested in developing strategies or systems that combine my architectural knowledge with a sonic experience: exploring responsive and critical design that draws strongly from Space to Sound and vice-versa.</p>

      <p>How can Architecture compose and mediate a sonic awareness? How can Sound Art shape and orchestrate a spatial idea?</p>
      <p>By intertwining theory, research and practice on both these fields with an aural and phenomenological approach, my works result in a continuous expression of this reciprocity narrative of Sound and Space.</p>

      <p>Due to the cross-pollination nature of the production process I believe collaboration projects work as an essential tool of investigation, learning and creation. The resulting reflections have been shaped in sound compositions, installations, performances, structures and systems.</p>
