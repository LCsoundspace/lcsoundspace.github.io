      <p>Liliana Carvalho is a Portuguese architect and sound artist with a Masters in Acoustics.
      <p>During her Diploma in Architecture she had the opportunity to study and work in Poland, Germany, Portugal and UK [London]. </p>
      <p>While partaking in her architectural studies, she was also involved with ru( as radio technician and broadcaster, where she discovered the active scene of electronic music, and gained her first hands-on experience in sound. She soon became increasingly connected, appearing as guest DJ or managing few events promoted by Portuguese techno label Soniculture; and was later involved with the production of Forte'14 Festival.
      The co-founding of the early stages of SonicLab served as a milestone for her in regards to forthcoming experimental projects with sound, commencing with the installation XNX and subsequently with the research project Sensorium.</p>
      <p>Eager to break <i>new ground</i> in Architecture she relocated to London in 2015, where during her employment as a practicing architect, she studied and solidified her practice in Sound Art. From sound installations to sonic releases, a scientific feature was added to this artistic knowledge when she decided to study Acoustics. This decision is later complemented with the establishing of her project and eco-acoustic brand - TerraSom. </p> 
      <p>These explorations and investigations are not only crucially influential when forming her artistic and scientific practices, but also important catalysts in making her determined to illustrate the inherent possible qualities that exist in the relationship between Sound and Space. </p>

      <h1>approach</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Interested in developing strategies or systems that combine architectural knowledge with a sonic and acoustic experience: exploring responsive and critical pondered design that draws strongly from Space to Sound or/and <i>vice-versa</i>.</p>

      <p><i>How can space compose and mediate a sonic awareness? How can sound shape and orchestrate a spatial idea?</i></p>
      <p>By intertwining theory and practice of architectural, acoustic and sound studies, with an aural and phenomenological approach, her works result in an interchangeable synergy between Sound and Space.</p>

      <p>Due to the cross-pollination nature of her production process, collaboration projects have generated paramount opportunities for investigation and learning, operating as tools for creation. The outcome reflections have been shaped and embodied in sound compositions, installations, performances, structures and systems.</p>
