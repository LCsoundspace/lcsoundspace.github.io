    <p>The concept behind XNX’s music is to create a ‘chaotic sonic bubble’.  I was invited to design a  spatial proposal that would best express this sonic statement.</p>
    <p>This installation was developed alongside with the artist to be presented at <a class="link" href="https://www.festivalsemibreve.com/"  target="_blank">Semibreve</a> the electronic music and digital art festival on its 2014 edition, alongside works such as ‘stroboscope and Linn LM-1’ from Mark Fell.</p>
    <p>In the provided room and with a tight budget, the project design displayed a labyrinthic route to immerse the listeners in a sonic maze. To emphasise this layout and its intricacy the illumination given was a synchronized light strobe that reacted to the XNX’s music continuously playing in the background.</p>
