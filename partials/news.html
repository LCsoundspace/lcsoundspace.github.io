      <strong>first day online!!!</strong>

      <p>In this difficult pandemic season we are facing now, it has been quite difficult for us to keep focus. I can say that fortunately I was blessed to spent my 14 days quarantine with an amazing software engineer + web developer that orchestrated this website to whom I will be grateful forever - <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrodrferreira/" target="_blank">Pedro Ferreira</a>.</p>

      <p>This website kept us quite busy and I can say that finally I was able to learn new skills for future endeavours on the web world. Please do go and explore <a class="link" href="/">it</a>!</p>
