      This pandemic crisis came to reveal in a dantesc way the precarious and fragile outlines and conditions this sector has been living under. Long time has passed now, a change must happen. It needs to be re-structure, re-build and re-thought. I join portuguese artists cause with willingness for this change.</p>
