      <p>It took me two long years of hard work and <i>on-site</i>  studies to deliver this work! It was a demanding job, due to the novelty of the <i>Soundscape</i> theme in the scientific community and the endeavor in crossing two different methodologies from two different fields of study. The result is an acoustic evaluation of the main Natural areas in my hometown - Choupal. <a class= "link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388177076_TOWARDS_AN_ASSESSEMENT_OF_HUMAN_IMPACT_IN_THE_SOUNDSCAPE_OF_NATURAL_AREAS_Comparison_study_of_ISO_12913_and_Soundscape_Ecology_methodologies_on_the_analysis_of_Mata_do_Choupal_Coimbra" target="_blank">Towards an assessement of human impact in the soundscape of Natural areas</a>: <i>Comparison study of ISO 12913 and Soundscape Ecology methodologies on the analysis of Mata do Choupal (Coimbra)</i> is a contributive interdisciplinary study with an ecological stem that investigates both methodologies' practices. It suggests a possible cross-pollination practice that integrates both [scientific and artistic] fields as a complementary narrative on the development of soundscape assessements on Natural/Wilderness areas.</p>

      <strong>The urge for a stronger and healthier cultural sector in Portugal </strong>
      <p>Yesterday the Portuguese artists came to the streets to express their unrest.
      This pandemic crisis came to reveal in a dantesc way the precarious and fragile outlines and conditions this sector has been living under. Long time has passed now, a change must happen. It needs to be re-structure, re-build and re-thought. I join portuguese artists cause with willingness for this change.</p>
